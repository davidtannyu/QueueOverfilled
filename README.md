## Structure

#### Back end

Its structure is RESTFUL. 
All data requests are done using AJAX and will respond with JSON.
To minimize SQL queries, associations are included to prefetch data.


### Front end
[React.js][React] and JavaScript handles the frontend.
The architecture used to design the website is [Flux][Flux].
React was chosen for its virtual DOM, which is known for quick rerenders
without the need to request a new page.
